# ANNOTATE ONLY THE INGRESS YOU WANT TO PROTECT.  NOT AUTHELIA THE INGRESS!!!
## YOU NEED TO HAVE SNIPPETS ALLOWED ON YOUR INGRESS; Doesn't work natively with rke2-nginx-ingress as it's disabled by default.
annotations:
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-method: GET
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-url: http://authelia.authelia.svc.cluster.local/api/verify
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-signin: https://auth.deiberts.domain.com?rm=$request_method
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-response-headers: Remote-User,Remote-Name,Remote-Groups,Remote-Email
  nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/auth-snippet: |
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Method $request_method;

## You still need an Authelia Ingress but you need to ensure that these additional annotations should only be used on other ingresses that needs protection.
